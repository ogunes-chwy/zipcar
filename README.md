Run in order of:
- run_simulation.py: Generates simulation for baseline / remediation / expansion for trailing look back day count.
- get_execution_rules_data.py: Gets unpadded dea / backlog / shutdown for trailing look back day count.
- execution_zip_recommendation.py: Recommend zips to remediate / expand and generates cost saving / ontrgd coverage / fc charge change estimations based on simulation.

Folders:
- data: Stores simulation / smf / execution data generated by run_simulation.py and get_execution_rules_data.py. this is input to execution_zip_recommendation.py.
- sql: sql scripts called by run_simulation.py and get_execution_rules_data.py
- results: 
    - zips_to_remediate: recommended zips to remediate daily. if file name ends with 99999, it means it includes all zip recommendations to remediate. otherwise, it includes X amount of zip codes to remediate.
    - zips_to_expand: recommended zips to expand daily. if file name ends with 99999, it means it includes all zip recommendations to expand. otherwise, it includes X amount of zip codes to expand.
    - simulation_output: simulation output by package with recommended remediate & expand changes.
    - metrics: ontrgd coverage change / fc charge change
    - metadata: metadata which includes all fields that is used for recommendation
